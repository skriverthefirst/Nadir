## **Case**
The seemless integration of the home, for me, is not seemless enough.  
I want to solve this, by making a simple app,which could lead to a web interface,  
from which you can add, control and delete your desired smart home products.

## **Brain twisting fix**
THIS WILL REQUIRE RESEACH ABOUT THE PHILIPS HUE  
As this is all about the seemless integration of smart home products, I am going to look for a way of doing NFC from the Philips HUE to a NFC reader to have the ability for making an easy and smooth way of integrating the products.
