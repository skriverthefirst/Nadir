## **Technologies**

### **Why did i choose these?**
A small explenation of why I chose the certain technologies.  

The software is based on earlier experience. I've worked with python before, but wanted to learn more about async programming with this.  
Python is a "easy to learn, fast to use", it's also well documented, this played a role aswell.  

My original plan was to use the Phillips Hue smart devices, but I could not get these, so the Ikea traadfri set was the next best thing.

### **Alternative Technologies**
I had some thoughts about other technologies to use, these can be seen here, with a small explenation of why I didn't choose them.  

* C# (for REST Interface)
    * C# is also a well matured & well documented language, but I based on current knowledge and the urge to create the REST Interface from the bottom, I chose Python.
* C++ (for REST Interface)
    * This was a hard one not to choose. C++ is a very cool language (by my opinion), and I could've gotten a micro controller to handle the REST Interface, which would create further complexity of the system, all tho this system was created to be simple, and not confuse the user, so I chose the solution of creating something that could be spin up on a raspberry (or equal), with an easy docker container, so Python was the choise.
* Phillips Hue (Used for hardware)
    * As I mentioned earlier, I wanted to develop this system using the Phillips Hue, but as I could not get these I went with the IKEA Traadfri.
