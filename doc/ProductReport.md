## **Introduction**

The sole purpose of this report is to give the reader an overview & understanding of the product created. The product's usage and functionality should be reflected by this report.

## **Case & Thesis Statement**

This read should give you an overview of what problem I am trying to solve.  
The case is a specific scenario, where the problem occurs.  
Thesis Statement is the specific problem.

### **Case**

You've just purchased a brand new smart home device, which you're going to install into your home, the product is nice, you're very excited about it, but then comes the setup process.  
This process is long and entangled in multiple steps.  
You wish there were an easier way to install it into your current system at home.

### **Thesis Statement**

How are we going to make the smart home integration more seemless?

We have multiple ways of solving this:  
* Add NFC to all Smart Devices so that when you hold the device close to your phone(e.g) it'll automatically integrate itself into the system.
* Create a layer between the smart device gateway and some sort of UI, that can handle multiple gateways & devices. (This is the way that I have chosen)
